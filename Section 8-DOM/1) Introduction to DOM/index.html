HTML elements can have attributes associated with them:

-for example, the id attribute is associated with the heading element
-the class attribute -- paragraph element
-type, name, value -- input element

The actual code you write is not the DOM- the code is parced? by the browser into the DOM

-if you click right source "View page source", it will show you the source code of the webpage, which is the html that makes up that page
-the browser creates a DOM of your webpage
-each time you load a webpage inside the browser,the web browser generates an internal representation of the page in the form of a structure, which is called DOM
-Ssometimes the browser fixes mistakes in your code :o
-all the elements are defined as OBJECTS and they have properties and methods=> dynamic webpages
-in DOM, everything is nod??
